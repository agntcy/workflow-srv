The Agent Workflow Server (AgWS) enables participation in the Internet of Agents [(IoA)](https://docs.agntcy.org/). It accommodates AI Agents from diverse frameworks and exposes them through Agent Connect Protocol [(ACP)](https://github.com/agntcy/acp-spec), regardless of their underlying implementation.

> [!NOTE]
> If you wish to quickly deploy and run your Agent, please check out the user-facing [Workflow Server Manager](https://github.com/agntcy/workflow-srv-mgr) instead.
